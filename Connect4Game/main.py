Connect4Game using AI Strategy to play against 2 competing players 10,000 games.

Score of each game is saved and displayed a bar chart with the players results.

Assumptions
- Connect4Game Board size: 6 rows Ã— 7 columns.
- Players are 1 and 2
- Winner is set with the winning player id
- A move is valid if the column is within the 7 columns and the column has available spaces out of 6
